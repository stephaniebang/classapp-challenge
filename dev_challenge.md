Dev Challenge
=============

Create a program in Node.js where the input defined in `input.csv`
is parsed and organized into the content shown in `output.json`.

Please write your program in only one file (like `index.js`) and
write the output to a file (`output.json`) instead of printing it
to logs or on the screen.

JSON order is not important, but its content is. The program should output
the same content (not necessarily the same order) if column order is changed.
Don't hard code the tags shown, meaning tags could be changed to
`"email Tio, Repons√°vel, Financeiro"` and it should still parse accordingly.

Some libraries that may be useful, but not required:
https://lodash.com/
https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-libphonenumber

**What will we consider?** Succinct code, great and descriptive methods and
variables, clear thinking skills, efficient code.
Code documentation is not really important if your code is simple, easy to
read and understand.
